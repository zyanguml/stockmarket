This is our latest project using maven.  We will put all bug fixes now in this project. 

We have incorporated feedback from our 1:1 - this includes
  - fixes to the Swing UI you suggested
  - adding maven support
  - changing directory structure
  - changing variable names
  
  
  We are working on doing the UI with JSP - we hope to have something in the next sprint.
  
  Note that not all team members can run maven right now - but we hope you can.  Let us know.
